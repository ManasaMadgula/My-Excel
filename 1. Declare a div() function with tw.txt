1. Declare a div() function with two parameters. Then call the function and pass two numbers and display their division. 




Hereâ€™s how you can declare a div() function in Python that takes two parameters, performs division, and then displays the result:

python
Copy code
def div(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return "Error: Division by zero is not allowed."
    return a / b

# Call the function and pass two numbers
result = div(10, 2)
print("The division result is:", result)
In this example:

The div() function takes two parameters, a and b.
It checks if b is zero to prevent division by zero errors.
If b is not zero, it returns the result of the division a / b.
Finally, the function is called with the numbers 10 and 2, and the result is printed.
You can change the numbers in the function call to test with different values!
