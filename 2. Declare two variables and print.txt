5. A transport company charges the fare according to the following table:

Distance        Charges


1-50             8 Rs./Km

51-100           10 Rs./Km

>100             12 Rs./Km





 The image shows a transportation fare table based on distance:

For distances between 1-50 km, the fare is 8 Rs/km.
For distances between 51-100 km, the fare is 10 Rs/km.
Program to Calculate the Fare Based on Distance
Hereâ€™s a Python program that calculates the fare based on the distance input by the user:

python
Copy code
# Function to calculate fare based on distance
def calculate_fare(distance):
    if 1 <= distance <= 50:
        fare = distance * 8  # 8 Rs/km for 1-50 km
    elif 51 <= distance <= 100:
        fare = distance * 10  # 10 Rs/km for 51-100 km
    else:
        return "Distance out of range"  # Handles distances outside the specified range
    return fare

# Input distance
distance = float(input("Enter the distance (in km): "))

# Calculate and print the fare
fare = calculate_fare(distance)
if isinstance(fare, str):
    print(fare)
else:
    print(f"The total fare is: Rs. {fare}")
This program:

Prompts the user to input the travel distance.
Uses conditions to check the distance range and applies the correct rate.
Prints the calculated fare based on the input distance.
