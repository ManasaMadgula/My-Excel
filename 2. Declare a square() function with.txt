2. Declare a square() function with one parameter.Then call the function and pass one number and display the square of that number . 





Hereâ€™s how you can declare a square() function in Python that takes one parameter, calculates its square, and then displays the result:

python
Copy code
def square(x):
    return x ** 2

# Call the function and pass one number
result = square(4)
print("The square of the number is:", result)
In this example:

The square() function takes one parameter, x.
It calculates the square of x using the exponentiation operator **.
The function is called with the number 4, and the result is printed.
You can replace 4 with any other number to find its square!
