4. Accept a name from the user and display that in lower case using lower() function




You can accept a name from the user and display it in lowercase using the lower() function in Python. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

python
Copy code
# Accept a name from the user
name = input("Please enter your name: ")

# Convert the name to lowercase
lowercase_name = name.lower()

# Display the name in lowercase
print("Your name in lowercase is:", lowercase_name)
Explanation:
The input() function prompts the user to enter their name.
The lower() method is called on the input string to convert it to lowercase.
Finally, the lowercase name is printed to the console.
