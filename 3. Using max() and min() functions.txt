3. Using max() and min() functions display the maximum and minimum of 5 random numbers. 




You can use the built-in max() and min() functions in Python to find the maximum and minimum of five random numbers. Hereâ€™s an example that demonstrates this:

python
Copy code
import random

# Generate 5 random numbers
random_numbers = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(5)]

# Calculate maximum and minimum
maximum = max(random_numbers)
minimum = min(random_numbers)

# Display the results
print("Random numbers:", random_numbers)
print("Maximum number:", maximum)
print("Minimum number:", minimum)
Explanation:
The random module is imported to generate random numbers.
A list comprehension is used to create a list of 5 random integers between 1 and 100.
The max() function finds the maximum number in the list, while min() finds the minimum.
Finally, the random numbers, maximum, and minimum values are printed.
