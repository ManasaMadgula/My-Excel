4. Write a Python program to split a given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is given. Original list: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1] Length of the first part of the list: 3 Splitted the said list into two parts: ([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1]) 

# Function to split a list into two parts
def split_list(original_list, split_length):
    # Ensure the split_length does not exceed the list length
    if split_length > len(original_list):
        return original_list, []  # Return the original list and an empty list

    first_part = original_list[:split_length]  # First part of the list
    second_part = original_list[split_length:]  # Second part of the list

    return first_part, second_part

# Example usage
my_list = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1]
length_of_first_part = 3
first_part, second_part = split_list(my_list, length_of_first_part)

print(f"Original list: {my_list}")
print(f"Length of the first part: {length_of_first_part}")
print(f"Splitted the said list into two parts: {first_part}, {second_part}")
